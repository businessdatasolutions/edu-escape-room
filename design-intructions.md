## Tutorial: Developing and Deploying Educational Escape Rooms

This tutorial uses the generic multilevel structure and insights from the article by Roig et al. (2024)[cite: 1, 3, 8, 9, 10].

### Phase 1: Development

**Step 1: Define the Structure and Learning Objectives**
* Adopt a generic multilevel structure where the escape room is a sequence of linear paths (levels)[cite: 31]. Each level must be cleared before starting the next one[cite: 31, 34].
* Dedicate each level to a specific didactic unit, chapter, or a particular domain of knowledge you want to assess or teach[cite: 32, 33].
* Each level should be composed of a string of sequential stages[cite: 34]. The article's example used 6 stages per level, aligning with their scoring system[cite: 46, 47, 73].
* This structure allows for the evaluation of acquired knowledge, skills, and attitudes[cite: 33].

**Step 2: Develop Puzzles and Progression Mechanics**
* Design tasks for each stage, typically in the form of exams or quizzes[cite: 36, 37]. These can include multiple-choice questions, fill-in-the-blank, and calculated questions with random variables from a question bank related to the level's content[cite: 36].
* Establish a clear scoring system where exam marks determine movement ("hops") through the stages[cite: 37, 39].
    * The article adapted the Spanish grading system (0-10, passing grade 5)[cite: 41].
    * If an exam outcome is below passing, no movement occurs[cite: 42].
    * If the outcome meets or exceeds passing, movement occurs, with higher scores granting more hops (e.g., a score of 5 gives 1 hop, a score of 10 gives 6 hops)[cite: 43, 45].
* Movement should be capped so that extra hops obtained do not carry over beyond the beginning of the next level[cite: 43, 50]. For instance, if a level has 6 stages, a top score from the first stage of a level moves the participant to the start of the next level[cite: 46, 47].

**Step 3: Create an Engaging Narrative and Atmosphere**
* Develop a compelling storyboard or theme for the escape room[cite: 62]. The article's use case was "Save the Earth," involving a mission to find a missing piece of a laser system to destroy a meteorite[cite: 63, 68, 69, 70, 71].
* Enhance immersion by using royalty-free epic music and relevant images displayed on an interactive whiteboard[cite: 64, 65].
* The instructor can also play a role in setting the atmosphere, for example, by dressing according to the theme or using introductory music and visuals[cite: 86, 87].
* Provide an introduction at the beginning for students to understand the context and their mission[cite: 66, 67].

**Step 4: Plan Logistics and Tools**
* Decide whether students will participate individually or in groups[cite: 38]. The use case described had students participating individually[cite: 62, 74].
* Allocate a specific time for the escape room, such as a full class session[cite: 38].
* Determine the grading for the escape room. The article suggests marks based on the time taken to complete it, with top marks for finishing within 60% of the session time, and progressively lower marks for longer times[cite: 52, 53]. Failing marks are for those not finishing[cite: 54, 100].
* Consider accessibility. For students with learning disabilities who might need more time, assign an escape room with fewer levels[cite: 55, 56].
* Utilize a Learning Management System (LMS) like Moodle, as in the article's example, to host and manage the escape room[cite: 67].

### Phase 2: Deployment and Assessment

**Step 5: Introduce and Run the Session**
* At the beginning of the session, the teacher should explain the background of the story and the rules[cite: 63, 67, 87]. Make sure students understand how to navigate and what the objectives are.
* Launch the escape room, playing any accompanying music or visuals[cite: 64, 86].

**Step 6: Monitor and Facilitate (If Necessary)**
* While the activity is designed for students to work through independently, be available for technical issues or critical clarifications.

**Step 7: Assess Performance and Gather Feedback**
* Assess students based on the predefined criteria (e.g., time to complete, number of levels cleared)[cite: 52, 53, 54]. The article details a marking scheme for students who completed within certain time percentages and for those who didn't complete but cleared some levels[cite: 100, 102].
* Consider complementing the escape room with other assessment methods, like project-based learning, as was done in the article[cite: 4, 20, 91]. The escape room accounted for two-thirds of the final mark in the use case[cite: 89].
* Measure student engagement[cite: 6, 21]. The article highlights that high engagement, measured via tools like the ISA engagement scale, is linked to better performance[cite: 134, 212, 229]. The results showed high engagement contributed to increased academic performance and success rates[cite: 5, 7, 229].

By following these steps, educators can create and implement effective and engaging escape room sessions that align with learning objectives and provide an active learning experience, potentially leading to increased academic performance and student success[cite: 5, 6].
